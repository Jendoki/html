        <p>In the central region of Abalathia's Spine, that great mountain range that spans Aldenard from east to west, can be found the forbidding highlands of Coerthas and the Holy See of Ishgard. The Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, Thordan VII, while leading his people in the teachings of Halone, the Fury, rules also as the nation's sovereign.</p>
        <p>shgard's formidable army of knights wages constant battle against its mortal enemies, the dragons, in the millennia long Dragonsong War. Faced with ever more aggressive attacks from its serpentine foes, as well as an unprecedented spell of bitter cold following the Calamity, the theocracy's days are dark indeed. Nevertheless, the city-state proper is warded with a layer of wards known as Daniffen's Collar to prevent direct assault from their draconic adversaries.</p>
        <p>Matters have grown so grave as to prompt the archbishop and his advisers to consider throwing open the heretofore sealed gates of Ishgard and calling for outside aid. The city-state's only known access point is a bridge called the Steps of Faith, blocked off by the Gate of Judgement. As of yet, adventurers are still forbidden from entering the city walls, though local garrisons at the Observatorium, Camp Dragonhead, and Whitebrim Front maintain services for travelers and may seek their aid.</p>
        <p>The city itself is divided into two known districts: Foundation at the bottom, and The Pillars above. Foundation appears to be home to lower class citizens, and exhibits scarring from war with visible damage to the stone structure. The Pillars is comparatively cleaner, with open-air plazas.</p>

        <h2 id="p2">Political structure</h2>
        <p>Since its founding, Ishgard has seen two political systems.</p>
        <h3>Founding</h3>
        <p>Ishgard is a strict theocracy led by the line of Thordan I, its current leader being Archbishop Thordan VII and his Heavens Ward. The Orthodox Church employs inquisitors to root out heresy among its populace (often with fatal results for the accused regardless of guilt or innocence). The church has a knightly order, the Temple Knights, led by Lord Commander Aymeric de Borel.</p>
        <p>Most of the power in Ishgard is concentrated in the nobility. Almost universally staunch traditionalists, they are reluctant to trust outsiders, or even the other city-states of the Eorzean Alliance. Within the city-state, the "lowborn" commonfolk are often viewed as little better than disposable servants by the "highborn" nobles and the church. The nobility is divided into four "High Houses", each descended from four of the Twelve Knights of legend. Each high house, led by a Count, is composed of lords and a knightly order, and the city-state's flag depicts the symbol of each house:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>House Fortemps: Founded by Flavien de Fortemps and symbolized by a unicorn. Currently led by Count Edmont de Fortemps.</li>
            <li>House Dzemael: Founded by Sylvetrel de Dzemael and symbolized by a tower/rook.</li>
            <li>House Haillenarte: Symbolized by a rose. Currently led by Count Baurendouin de Haillenarte.</li>
            <li>House Durendaire: Symbolized by a bell.</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>After Dragonsong War</h3>
        <p>After the Dragonsong War ended, Ishgard was changed into a republic lead by a two-chamber parliament, the House of Lords consisting of the high-born and the House of Commons consisting of the low-born. The church was separated from the state.</p>

        <h2 id="p3">Story</h2>
        <p>Long ago, a group of Elezen came to settle in Coerthas and found themselves in conflict with the dragons of Dravania until tales of Saint Shiva sacrificing herself to Hraesvelgr out of love inspired peace between the two races. But it only lasted two hundred years as the Ascians revealed to the Elezen king Thordan I that the dragons' power come from their eyes. With that knowledge, Thordan betrayed the dragon Ratatoskr and killed her before he and his men ate the flesh of her eyes for power. Then, claiming his people have been chosen by Halone, the Fury, Thordan urged the proto-Ishgardians to claim the Promised Land upon the Abalathia's Spine on which Ishgard would be founded by first making a great bridge across the Sea of Clouds.
        </p>
        <p>But the Elezen were attacked by a vengeful Nidhogg and Thordan fearlessly engaged the colossal wyrm in battle that lasted seven days and cost him the lives of half of his twelve knights before he was pushed into the chasm by his men who was enthralled by the wyrmking. But Thordan's son Haldrath took his father's spear and avenged him by taking Nidhogg's eyes, forcing the dragon to retreat. Though he believed Nidhogg would not be long for this world, a guilt-ridden Haldrath saw himself unworthy of the throne and left Ishgard's care to his father's remaining knights: The founders of the High Houses who would fabricate the events to conceal their horrific deed and make it appear that the dragons attacked them unprovoked. Furthermore, they fathered the population with the descendants divided into the High Born who make the High Houses and the Low Born with both unaware of their common ancestory due to the Ishgard Orthodoxy Church which became Ishgard's ruling government.</p>
        <p>After forcing Hraesvelgr to give him one of his eyes, Nidhogg rallied the Dravanian Horde to enact his revenge through the Dragonsong War. While everyone believed that Nidhogg wanted to simply slaughter everyone in Ishgard, his revenge was also by exposing those descended from the founders to dragon blood, causing Ratatoskr's influence to take hold and turn willing Ishgardians like Guillaime and the heretics into dragon-like beasts to serve in his army.</p>
        <p>As shown in Final Fantasy XIV and A Realm Reborn, a somewhat paranoid people and do not allow "foreigners" into their city, the Ishgardians declined to play a role in the restoration of the Eorzean Alliance against the threat posed by Nael van Darnus and Project Meteor. This barring of "foreigners" continued after the Seventh Umbral Era came to pass as Ishgard, despite indirectly aiding in the search for Cid's airship, decline to join in Operation Archon. Furthermore, Thordan is seen with Lahabrea and Elidibus are seen flanking him, suggesting the Ascians have been manipulating the theocracy.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the Ishgardians become more involved in Eorzean matters due to the heretics under Ysayle attempting to summon their patron Saint Shiva as a Primal. In addition, Ser Aymeric has stated that the astrologers of Ishgard believe the wyrmking Midgardsormr would soon be resurrected. When this comes to pass, Nidhogg awakens and renews the Dragonsong War with Dravanian Horde preparing for a large-scale assault against the Holy See. During the events of Before the Fall, knowing they would need Ishgard to stand against the Garlean Empire, the Eorzea Alliance send a small group of Eorzeans to aid the Ishgardians by defending the Steps of Faith against Nidhogg's champion Vishap.</p>
        <p>After the Ul'dahn Revolution occurred, the events of Heavensward have the Warrior of Light, Alphinaud Leveilleur, and Tataru departing to Ishgard. But the two falsely accused of heresy by the Heavens' Ward with the Adventure forced to prove their innocence via a trial by combat. Thordan apologizes to The Adventurer for the false conviction, and then boldly mentions that he has been contacted by the Ascians and has agreed to work with them. He claims this to be a ruse, intending simply to learn what the Ascians are planning. But the two eventually learn the true cause of the Dragonsong War and find themselves dealing with both Nidhogg and Thordan after he betrayed the Ascians with the intention to usher in a new age of peace as a god-king. But after Thordan falls in battle, Aymeric becomes the new ruler of Ishgard as he promises Midgardsormr to end the war between their kinds while joining the Eorzean Alliance.</p>
        <p>Though Aymeric believed it would be best he lead Ishgard rather than have a successor to Thordan be elected, his attempt to reveal the truth of the Dragonsong War made him a marked man by those who refuse to accept it. Aymeric attempts to ease the peoples' worry by forging a truce with Vidofnir and her kin. But one group, the True Brothers of the Faith, believed Aymeric to be guilty of patricide and treason to the point of making an attempt on his life and then burning Ishgard. When both attempts fail, the zealots take the refugees they gave sanctuary in the Vault hostage to force Aymeric to step down and be trialed. But Aymeric leads a rescue party to save the hostages, with one of them saved by Vidofnir at the last second. Though Vidofnir accepts the offer of peace, she also warns the Ishgardians to be on their guard as Nidhogg and his brood are about to make their move.</p>
